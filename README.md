# OVERVIEW

This is intended to be a very simple disposable piece of code where I can create a single
file for solving online problems and a single file for unit tests associated with that
problem.   My core language is Python, but I tend to extend it so that it can use other
languages.

I also intend git to be usable within this directory (although not as a remote repo that
gets updated), so that the code can be stored.
